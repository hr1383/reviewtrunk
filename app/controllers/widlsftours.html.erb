The guide (Fisher) was highly knowledgeable and made it interesting with humor and historical anecdotes. Gave great recommendation for places to eat and places to visit while in SF. Also, we got to meet other tourists from different places world wide. Highly recommended.",

We were trying to find a drag show or brunch while in town & were not successful. But to our surprise we did get a show. Very knowledgeable & enjoyable. Thank you.",

				"text": "This is the second Free walking tour we've taken in a month. I previously reviewed the Free Walking Tour in Tallinn, Estonia. We enjoyed that walk, so decided to take this one of our new hometown. We enjoyed it a great deal. The guide was prepared with jokes and stories about the people who made San Francisco the city it is. My favorite, Big Alma, who gave the language the phrase sugar daddy. Many non-native English speakers from several foreign countries were part of the group though the guide spoke only English. That did not seem to be a problem, though the street noise makes it hard to hear sometimes. Our guide saves some of his best bits for place of relative quiet. All in all, this was an excellent program, well thought out, about the right length, and cheap. Start with the main walk, then sign up for paid tours from the company if they match your interests.",

We went to so many marvellous places, heard some fascinations facts and surmising too. Will be a lasting memory of a twilight tour around the streets near Union Square thanks Jeanette and Ennio Australia.",

Sebastian was a knowledgeable, personable, and entertaining tour guide! We have been on a couple walking tours in different cities, and this was the best thus far. Highly recommend!",

				"text": "Although the Wild SF Walking Tour wasn't as spooky as marketed, it was super fun! Lots of old SF history shared in a "keep you on the edge of your seat" sort of way, with our awesome guide, Sebastian! The total walk is approximately a half mile done in an hour and a half, all on flat streets with lots of stops indoors at various hotels. Great way to see Union Square after hours and enjoy the ambiance of San Francisco. Would recommend to the out of town tourist!",

				"text": "Last night my friend and I did the Haunted SF: Ghosts, Murder and Mystery walking tour with Sebastian. He was incredible! I've been on other city walking tours and expected the normal tour-guide situation. Nope. Sebastian is a talented performer and energetic host. Turns out, he is actually a worldwide sensation and travels the world for acting gigs. I won't be surprised when I see his name in lights in the future and will love saying, "hey, I did a walking tour with him." This is a great adventure for tourists and locals alike. As someone who has lived in the city the better part of a decade, it was great to walk the streets I know well, add to stories I knew about and hear new ones. I should also point out that Sebastian made sure to keep us safe. He was careful to discuss traffic, stop lights and remind us that we were in a city where homeless people live and drunk people party! I will definitely be checking out the rest of the tours. I just hope I get Sebastian again!! ;-)!",

The real life stories were fun, and spooky and especially interesting when you're able to see first hand where the stories occurred! Our tour guide Mary was phenomenal, 10/10 recommend. Thank you Mary for the great experience!",

Your best bet is to text them for a reservation. Tour started on time, and I felt very welcome.  Don't worry about having to walk up and down the hills.  He kept us on flat land the entire time.  Loved the history lesson and the laughs.  Highly recommended!",

				"text": "My class and I went on a school field trip and took a Wild SF Tour with Fischer and Mina through Chinatown and North Beach. We started off at a Chinese dim sum restaurant in America called, Hang Ah which we found out was the first dim sum place in America! This was probably my favorite place on the entire tour. We then moved onto a boba shop called, Steap, where we got boba tea but unfortunately, we were not told what we were drinking. Fischer and Mina took us to the only fortune cookie factory where they fold their cookies by hand and got us some fortune cookies and we learned some information on where the cookie was invented and how it was invented but there are many different opinions on that. We moved onto North Beach but did not get much information. Our tour was cut a little bit short but more information on North Beach would have been nice. I think it would have been better if we had more time in certain places because we were walking and drinking our boba but barely got a break in between each place. I recommend this tour for people who can eat back to back but it was fun.",
